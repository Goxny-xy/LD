    "text": "2.1 Summary\n\n2.1.1 What is remote sensing?\nA scientific method and technique for gathering data about the Earth’s surface, atmosphere, and oceans without making physical touch with the item is called remote sensing. The method is dependent on the identification and quantification of electromagnetic radiation that is either reflected or emitted from a target area or object. A variety of platforms, including as satellites, aeroplanes, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground stations, can be equipped with remote sensing technology to gather a variety of data about the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 How it works?\nActive remote sensing: electromagnetic waves are emitted by the sensors and are reflected back from features. For example, a radar system measures a feature’s distance, shape, roughness, and other characteristics by sending out microwaves and receiving their reply.\nPassive remote sensing: depends on the feature itself or on electromagnetic radiation released by a natural light source (like the sun). When sunlight strikes the Earth’s surface, for instance, sensors aboard satellites or aircraft catch the light reflected from features."

    "section": "2.2 Applications",
    "text": "2.2 Applications\nRemote sensing has obvious advantages in environmental monitoring, crop estimation, disaster monitoring, global change, and many more. I am most interested in disaster monitoring, especially earthquakes (because the recent film I watched with the crustal rupture sequence made me feel the need to prepare some knowledge about earthquakes).\nThis week’s study has led me to search and read a lot of articles about remote sensing applications, and I found that it is interesting and difficult to monitor small vibrations like pre-earthquakes and aftershocks. For example, in the case of the Iranian earthquake, there are at least two different ways to observe its seismicity.\nDing et al., (2018) focused on monitoring surface deformation via InSAR by comparing radar images acquired at different times, accurately measuring surface movement, and inverting slip distributions and rupture processes to detect where earthquakes are most likely to occur. While Saraf et al., (2008) used thermal infrared to detect earthquakes where they are most likely to occur by monitoring the surface temperature changes and visually analysing the thermal images, which are then analysed in detail to understand the approximate time of occurrence of thermal anomalies, the intensity of thermal rise, and its spatial extent to monitor earthquakes.\nSince Iran is part of the Alpine-Himalayan belt, it belongs to one of the most seismic regions in the world, and in addition to the high seismic activity, it has relatively cloudless and stable weather conditions for most of the year as well as sparse vegetation cover. Based on these two prerequisites, InSAR is more advantageous. Moreover, the frictional heat generated on the fault surface during rupture takes some time to reach the surface, which may make thermal infrared monitoring of earthquakes inaccurate.\nIt was also nice to discover that Liu et al., (2021) found that the optimised approach to InSAR is time series (I didn’t realise that a course I had once taken could still be applied here) because using time series analysis, it is possible to detect small co-seismic events that are not readily visible or clearly defined in a single interferogram. seen or unclear in small coseismic displacements, and to improve images of earthquakes by looking at how estimates of ground motion change over time, leading to clearer observations of earthquakes and modelling of aftershocks following large earthquakes."

Most importantly, remote sensing is dedicated to finding workable solutions, which makes me feel that it has value in the social, environmental, and economic domains. It even makes me consider the satisfaction of using what I have learned to truly assist in problem solving—something I may do in the future."

    "text": "4.1 Summary\n\n4.1.1 Atmosphereic correction\n\n4.1.1.1  Dark Object Subtraction (DOS)\nThe dark subtraction processor implements a simple empirical “atmospheric correction” method of calculation for the source product. This method searches for the darkest pixel value in each band and removes the scattering by subtracting that value from each pixel in the band, thus correcting the original satellite (or any other) image.\nIt is assumed that the darkest parts of the image (water, man-made structures) should be black if there is no effect of atmospheric scattering. A correction is made so that the black value of one band can be used to correct the remaining bands.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 enhancement\n\n4.1.2.1 Ratio: Normalised Difference Vegetation Index NDVI\nIt is a simple graphical metric commonly used to analyse remotely sensed measurements and to assess whether an observation target contains green and healthy vegetation. It quantifies vegetation based on measuring the difference between near-infrared (NIR), which is strongly reflected by vegetation, and red light, which is absorbed by vegetation/has low reflectivity. It’s calculated as follows:\nThe NDVI values range between -1 and 1, and will increase proportionally with vegetation growth. (An area without any growth will have an NDVI of zero.) An area with dense, healthy vegetation will have an NDVI of 1. An area with dense, healthy vegetation will have an NDVI of 1. An NDVI value of less than 0 indicates a lack of drylands. The NDVI of the ocean will be -1.)\n\n\n\nThe example of how to calculate NDVI. Source: NDVI from First Principles\n\n\nTherefore, it can also be said that NDVI is an indicator of the health of green vegetation. Its accuracy and high correlation with the real state of the ground vegetation is very popular.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Texture\nTexture is one of the most important features in the process of image interpretation and classification. Compared to other important spatial features (e.g., shape and size), it is relatively simple to use because it does not require prior image segmentation. In the lecture we learned about the use of grey scale covariance matrices (GLCM) to look at features in different regions.\n\n\n\nThe Comparison of Different Methods of Texture Analysis for Their Efficacy for Land Use Classification in Satellite Imagery (Kupidura 2019).\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 PCA\nPCA is used to remove redundant spectral information from multi-band datasets and is therefore a form of dimensionality reduction. We can specify whether to perform normalised PCA and the number of output components to be generated (all components will be output unless otherwise specified)."

    "text": "4.2 Applications\nOcean colour (OC) remote sensing is important for monitoring marine ecosystems. However, inversion of OC signals from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance measured by satellite sensors remains a challenge because the inversion accuracy is highly dependent on the performance of atmospheric corrections and sensor calibration.\nIt has been studied that the performance of dark target subtraction is satisfactory for coastal and inland water applications of Landsat TM and SeaWiFS (Shanmugam and Ahn 2007). However, it is worth noting that this method’s ability to retrieve land surface reflectance properties with high accuracy is problematic for accurate atmospheric correction of satellite ocean colour images of aquatic environments. This is because the surface reflectance usually does not contain information about the water column. The residual radiance signal from the water column accounts for only 10-20 per cent of the TOA signal, which is much smaller than the contribution of surface reflected light to the TOA signal."

This process is important for increasing the value of remote sensing data for applications, whether it plays an integral role in land cover classification, vegetation monitoring or environmental assessment.\nSecond, texture is an essential component of the picture that can reveal details about the surface’s composition and structure, both of which are critical for remote sensing image interpretation. Different classes can be readily detected using the texture information of the image, which can lead to more accurate work in the future.\nOverall, studying texture analysis and atmospheric correction has deepened my understanding of the use and promise of remote sensing technologies for real-world issue solving."
