    "text": "2.1 Summary\n\n2.1.1 What is remote sensing?\nA scientific method and technique for gathering data about the Earth’s surface, atmosphere, and oceans without making physical touch with the item is called remote sensing. The method is dependent on the identification and quantification of electromagnetic radiation that is either reflected or emitted from a target area or object. A variety of platforms, including as satellites, aeroplanes, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground stations, can be equipped with remote sensing technology to gather a variety of data about the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 How it works?\nActive remote sensing: electromagnetic waves are emitted by the sensors and are reflected back from features. For example, a radar system measures a feature’s distance, shape, roughness, and other characteristics by sending out microwaves and receiving their reply.\nPassive remote sensing: depends on the feature itself or on electromagnetic radiation released by a natural light source (like the sun). When sunlight strikes the Earth’s surface, for instance, sensors aboard satellites or aircraft catch the light reflected from features."

    "text": "2.2 Applications\nRemote sensing has obvious advantages in environmental monitoring, crop estimation, disaster monitoring, global change, and many more. I am most interested in disaster monitoring, especially earthquakes (because the recent film I watched with the crustal rupture sequence made me feel the need to prepare some knowledge about earthquakes).\nThis week’s study has led me to search and read a lot of articles about remote sensing applications, and I found that it is interesting and difficult to monitor small vibrations like pre-earthquakes and aftershocks. For example, in the case of the Iranian earthquake, there are at least two different ways to observe its seismicity.\nKaihua Ding, Ping He, Yangmao Wen, Yunguo Chen, Dun Wang, Shuiping Li, and Qi Wang (2018) focused on monitoring surface deformation via InSAR by comparing radar images acquired at different times, accurately measuring surface movement, and inverting slip distributions and rupture processes to detect where earthquakes are most likely to occur. While Arun K. Saraf, Vineeta Rawat, Priyanka Banerjee, Swapnamita Choudhury, Santosh K. Panda, Sudipta Dasgupta, and J. D. Das (2008) used thermal infrared to detect earthquakes where they are most likely to occur by monitoring the surface temperature changes and visually analysing the thermal images, which are then analysed in detail to understand the approximate time of occurrence of thermal anomalies, the intensity of thermal rise, and its spatial extent to monitor earthquakes.\nSince Iran is part of the Alpine-Himalayan belt, it belongs to one of the most seismic regions in the world, and in addition to the high seismic activity, it has relatively cloudless and stable weather conditions for most of the year as well as sparse vegetation cover. Based on these two prerequisites, InSAR is more advantageous. Moreover, the frictional heat generated on the fault surface during rupture takes some time to reach the surface, which may make thermal infrared monitoring of earthquakes inaccurate.\nIt was also nice to discover that F. Liu, J. R. Elliott, T. J. Craig, A. Hooper, and T. J. Wright (2021) found that the optimised approach to InSAR is time series (I didn’t realise that a course I had once taken could still be applied here) because using time series analysis, it is possible to detect small co-seismic events that are not readily visible or clearly defined in a single interferogram. seen or unclear in small coseismic displacements, and to improve images of earthquakes by looking at how estimates of ground motion change over time, leading to clearer observations of earthquakes and modelling of aftershocks following large earthquakes."

    "text": "2.3 Reflections\nLearning theoretical concepts like electromagnetic wave theory and sensor principles is only one aspect of studying remote sensing technology; another is actually downloading, processing, and analysing data through hands-on operations. Most importantly, remote sensing is dedicated to finding workable solutions, which makes me feel that it has value in the social, environmental, and economic domains. It even makes me consider the satisfaction of using what I have learned to truly assist in problem solving—something I may do in the future."
